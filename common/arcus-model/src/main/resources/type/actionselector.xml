    GROUP - List&lt;Tuple&lt;String,List&lt;ActionSelector&gt;&gt;, a list of label and selector tuples.  The selectors associated with each grouping are the additional or sub-selectors that should be used when the target is added to that group.  For example a dimmer would have a PERCENT selector in the ON group, but no selectors in the OFF group.
    RANGE - Not set
    PERCENT - Not set
    THERMOSTAT - Not set
    TEMPERATURE - A numeric value
